# HEALTH-CHECK AND FAMILY FINDER
During or after any natural disaster the most important thing is the health of the person effected by the natural disaster.
The information about the family member who are missing .
we want to creat a data base of all the people in different relief camps.
The database should contain information about the health of person and the name and photo of their family member .
When we have the information about the health of the person we can provide them appropriate medicine targeted towards their perticular health problem.
With the information about the family member we can check continuously whether the missing family member is present in different relief camps.
With the information about the number of people in the relief camps we can keep a count on how much food and drinking water bottles are required.
With this information we can estimate the amount of money required to help the people in need.
we can now create a web site or an app that will allow people to donate money .
